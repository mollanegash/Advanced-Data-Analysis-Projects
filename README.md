# Advanced Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of my advanced data analysis projects, completed through the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate (Coursera)**, as well as personal data science work.

## Contents

- 📁 **Data/** – Raw and cleaned datasets for analysis
- 📁 **Notebooks/** – Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling
- 📁 **Reports/** – Final reports and summaries (PDF versions)
- 🧾 **requirements.txt** – Python dependencies for running the project

## Tools & Skills

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for data analysis
- **Data Cleaning** and **Transformation**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Visualization** and **Summary Reporting**
- **Machine Learning Modeling** (for predictive analysis)
